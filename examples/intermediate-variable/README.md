# Intermediate variable example

This folder shows examples of how to use the [intermediate-variable module](/modules/intermediate-variable)
to store intermediate variables that contain interpolations.




## How do you run these examples?

1. Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).
1. Open `vars.tf`, set the environment variables specified at the top of the file, and fill in any other variables that
   don't have a default.
1. Run `terraform get`.
1. Run `terraform plan`.
1. If the plan looks good, run `terraform apply`.
